# LogiReader
An intuitive platform for reading Logiscool CRM Surveys.

## How
It works by taking in an excel file exported from the CRM Surveys, and creates a user-frinedly GUI, for easy reading.
Here's an example file, to test with: [ujtesztfajl.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16228440/ujtesztfajl.xlsx)

This project was started in 23_08 to make survey reading easier, and more fun, or at least not difficult.

## Features
- ~~Disgusting codebase~~
- Fun and intuitive UI
- Cool extras
  - Strict counter
